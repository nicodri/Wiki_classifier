      "DRUG\n",
      "The term encompasses any of a large variety of different anticancer drugs, which are divided into broad categories such as alkylating agents and antimetabolites . However, radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed cGy. Also, when chemotherapy is being given after birth, many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby, which could harm the baby.  \n",

      "PROGNOSIS\n",
      "Together, this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis of the patient and to choose the best treatment. These tests may provide information about the molecular changes (such as mutations , fusion genes , and numerical chromosome changes) that have happened in the cancer cells, and may thus also indicate the future behavior of the cancer (prognosis) and best treatment. Once a cancer has metastasized or spread beyond its original site, the prognosis normally becomes much worse. This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between and Though many diseases (such as heart failure ) may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos.  \n",

      "SYMPTOM\n",
      "Possible signs and symptoms include: a new lump, abnormal bleeding, a prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss , and a change in bowel movements among others. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may also occur due to other issues. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests . Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. When cancer begins, it invariably produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms only appear as the mass continues to grow or ulcerates . Few symptoms are specific , with many of them also frequently occurring in individuals who have other conditions. Thus, it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with cancer to have been treated for other diseases, which were assumed to be causing their symptoms. Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. General symptoms occur due to distant effects of the cancer that are not related to direct or metastatic spread. Some cancers may cause specific groups of systemic symptoms, termed paraneoplastic phenomena . The symptoms of metastatic cancers depend on the location of the tumor, and can include enlarged lymph nodes (which can be felt or sometimes seen under the skin and are typically hard), enlarged liver or enlarged spleen , which can be felt in the abdomen , pain or fracture of affected bones, and neurological symptoms. Most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening . Unlike diagnosis efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs , cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed, but before any noticeable symptoms appear. Even when it is impossible for chemotherapy to provide a permanent cure, chemotherapy may be useful to reduce symptoms like pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will be possible in the future. Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve the symptoms of cancer. Multiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for people whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea) or who need help coping with their illness. Diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult, in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy.  \n",

      "DIAGNOSIS\n",
      "In children under at diagnosis the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average For cancer in the United States the average five-year survival rate is In about million new cases of cancer occurred globally (not including skin cancer other than melanoma ). Neither of these lead to a definitive diagnosis, which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist . The tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its histological grade , genetic abnormalities, and other features of the tumor. It is typically an important part of making the definitive diagnosis and staging the tumor as biopsies are usually required. However, the survival rates vary dramatically by type of cancer, and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, with the range running from the great majority of people surviving to almost no one surviving as long as five years after diagnosis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CAUSE\n",
      "Tobacco use is the cause of about of cancer deaths. It caused about million deaths or of all human deaths . For example, mass effects from lung cancer can cause blockage of the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia ; esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel, resulting in changes in bowel habits. Ulceration can cause bleeding that, if it occurs in the lung, will lead to coughing up blood , in the bowels to anemia or rectal bleeding , in the bladder to blood in the urine , and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen . Hodgkin disease , leukemias , and cancers of the liver or kidney can cause a persistent fever of unknown origin . Environmental , as used by cancer researchers, means any cause that is not inherited genetically , such as lifestyle, economic and behavioral factors, and not merely pollution. It is nearly impossible to prove what caused a cancer in any individual, because most cancers have multiple possible causes. For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, then there is a small chance that the cancer developed because of air pollution or radiation. Tobacco smoking , for example, causes of lung cancer . It also causes cancer in the larynx , head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas . Aflatoxin , a frequent food contaminate, causes liver cancer. Betel nut chewing causes oral cancer. Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also have an effect. A virus that can cause cancer is called an oncovirus . Additionally, the vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation , mostly from sunlight. Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB , as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers , which are the most common forms of cancer in the world. Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect. Less than of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than of all cancer. Some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells. A prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos , naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma , which is a cancer of the serous membrane , usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs. Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel , and crystalline silica ( quartz , cristobalite , and tridymite ). Similarly, physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer, breast cancer, or brain cancer. Generally, it is believed that the cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of repairing the trauma, rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma. It is controversial whether chronic inflammation can directly cause mutation. Some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels, and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers. The errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding , for example: The transformation of normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape the controls that limit normal tissue growth. Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation) and histone modification and changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as or ). Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers. Reduced expression of DNA repair genes causes deficient DNA repair. (In the figure, red wording indicates the central role of DNA damage and defects in DNA repair in progression to cancer.) When DNA repair is deficient DNA damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level level from the top in figure), and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation level from top of figure). Higher levels of DNA damage not only cause increased mutation (right side of figure), but also cause increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing. Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause an increased risk of cancer. However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about percent of cancers. In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms. As pointed out above under genetic alterations, cancer is caused by failure to regulate tissue growth, when the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation are altered. It has become clear that these alterations are caused by both DNA sequence mutation in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as by epigenetic alterations. The epigenetic deficiencies in expression of DNA repair genes, in particular, likely cause an increased frequency of mutations, some of which then occur in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Not all environmental causes are controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation , and other cases of cancer are caused through hereditary genetic disorders, and thus it is not possible to prevent all cases of cancer. In the general population, NSAIDs reduce the risk of colorectal cancer , however due to the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects they cause overall harm when used for prevention. Survival is worse in the developing world, partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are at present harder to treat than those associated with the lifestyle of developed countries. Additionally, patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report a lower quality of life directly because they correctly perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal. This makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in the developing world . Autopsy studies in Europe and Asia have shown that up to of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths, and that of men develop prostate cancer by age As these cancers did not cause the person's death, identifying them would have represented overdiagnosis rather than useful medical care. Galen stated that \"cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins\". In the and centuries, it became acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius , a follower of Descartes , believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. The physician John Hill described tobacco snuff as the cause of nose cancer in This was followed by the report in by British surgeon Percivall Pott that chimney sweeps' carcinoma , a cancer of the scrotum , was a common disease among chimney sweeps . This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma skin cancers , accounting for about one-third of all cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths —are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure. In the a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment was a specialized form of talk therapy , based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude. Among other effects, this belief allows society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer (by \"wanting\" it) or having prevented its cure (by not becoming a sufficiently happy, fearless, and loving person). This is based upon the blamers' belief that the world is fundamentally just, and so any dangerous illness, like cancer, must be a type of punishment for bad choices, because in a just world, bad things would not happen to good people. In of Hispanics and of children years old or younger lacked health insurance; \"uninsured patients and those from ethnic minorities are substantially more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, when treatment can be more extensive and more costly.\" Because cancer is a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \" cure for cancer \" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases . Research about cancer causes focuses on the following issues: The improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to a number of new treatments for cancer since U.S. Because cancer is largely a disease of older adults, it is not common in pregnant women. Surgery is generally safe, but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage.  \n",

      "PREVENTION\n",
      "Complex error correction and prevention is built into the process, and safeguards the cell against cancer. An invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (pale area at the center) surrounded by spikes of whitish scar tissue and yellow fatty tissue An invasive colorectal carcinoma (top center) in a colectomy specimen A squamous-cell carcinoma (the whitish tumor) near the bronchi in a lung specimen A large invasive ductal carcinoma in a mastectomy specimen Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease the risk of cancer. Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish, and an avoidance of processed and red meat (beef, pork, lamb), animal fats, and refined carbohydrates. Carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "TREATMENT\n",
      "The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. Clonal evolution leads to intra- tumour heterogeneity that complicates designing effective treatment strategies. Many treatment options for cancer exist, with the primary ones including surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , targeted therapy and palliative care . Which treatments are used depends on the type, location, and grade of the cancer as well as the person's health and wishes. The treatment intent may be curative or not curative. Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or more cytotoxic anti- neoplastic drugs ( chemotherapeutic agents ) as part of a standardized regimen . The radiation is most commonly low energy x-rays for treating skin cancers while higher energy x-ray beams are used in the treatment of cancers within the body. Surgery is the primary method of treatment of most isolated solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival. Palliative care refers to treatment that attempts to make the person feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to treat the cancer. Unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells, the primary goal of palliative care is to improve the person's quality of life . People at all stages of cancer treatment should have some kind of palliative care to provide comfort. Unlike hospice care, palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at prolonging their lives or curing the cancer. Additionally, an oncologist should consider a palliative care consult in any person they feel has less than months of life even if continuing aggressive treatment. Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of health care systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine. Some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted. Taken as a whole, about half of people receiving treatment for invasive cancer (excluding carcinoma in situ and non-melanoma skin cancers) die from cancer or its treatment. The increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, partly due to the treatment for the first cancer, and potentially related to better compliance with screening. A centenarian is unlikely to survive for five years even if the treatment is successful. People with lower quality of life may be affected by major depressive disorder and other complications from cancer treatment and/or disease progression that both impairs their quality of life and reduces their quantity of life. BC – AD) translated karkinos into the Latin cancer , also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment. The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments. Some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer. The idea was excoriated by the notoriously outspoken Susan Sontag , who published Illness as Metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in Although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense, the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread, but incorrect, belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival. — including treatment and indirect mortality expenses (such as lost productivity in the workplace) — was estimated to be billion. Angiogenesis inhibitors were once thought to have potential as a \" silver bullet \" treatment applicable to many types of cancer, but this has not been the case in practice. Experimental cancer treatments are treatments that are being studied to see whether they work. Typically, these are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment. They may be entirely new treatments, or they may be treatments that have been used successfully in one type of cancer, and are now being tested to see whether they are effective in another type. More and more, such treatments are being developed alongside companion diagnostic tests to target the right drugs to the right patients, based on their individual biology. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Some treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester , increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths). Some treatments may interfere with the mother's ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed her baby. Veterinary oncology , concentrating mainly on cats and dogs, is a growing specialty in wealthy countries, and the major forms of human treatment such as surgery and radiotherapy may be offered.  \n",

      "SYMPTOM\n",
      "In the United States, diabetes cost billion in The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are weight loss, polyuria (increased urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger). Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of diabetes, although they are not specific to the disease. These typically develop after many years but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time. The symptoms can include numbness, tingling, pain, and altered pain sensation, which can lead to damage to the skin. The rare disease diabetes insipidus has similar symptoms to diabetes mellitus, but without disturbances in the sugar metabolism ( insipidus means \"without taste\" in Latin) and does not involve the same disease mechanisms. This is possibly due to the diet and life-style of the ancient people, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease. He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the \"Pneumatic School\". People with diabetes who have neuropathic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in feet or hands are twice as likely to be unemployed as those without the symptoms. The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious.  \n",

      "DIAGNOSIS\n",
      "citation needed Prediabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type DM. He hypothesized a correlation of diabetes with other diseases and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite which also provokes excessive thirst.  \n",
      "\n",
      "CAUSE\n",
      "If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Insulin and some oral medications can cause low blood sugar . Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye , which leads to changes in its shape, resulting in vision changes. Damage to the eyes, known as diabetic retinopathy , is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina of the eye, and can result in gradual vision loss and blindness . Additionally, proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle wasting and weakness. The \"other specific types\" are a collection of a few dozen individual causes. It causes approximately of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe. Type diabetes can affect children or adults, but was traditionally termed \"juvenile diabetes\" because a majority of these diabetes cases were in children. A lack of exercise is believed to cause of cases. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause respiratory distress syndrome . Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis ). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). The following is a comprehensive list of other causes of diabetes: Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test. Glycated hemoglobin is better than fasting glucose for determining risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that diabetes resulted in million deaths in making it the leading cause of death. The discrepancy between the two estimates is due to the fact that cardiovascular diseases are often the cause of death for individuals with diabetes; the IDF uses modelling to estimate the amount of deaths that could be attributed to diabetes.  \n",

      "Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help in the prevention of diabetes.  \n",

      "TREATMENT\n",
      "There are three main types of diabetes mellitus: Prevention and treatment involve a healthy diet , physical exercise , maintaining a normal body weight , and avoiding use of tobacco . Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels. The goal of treatment is an HbA level of but should not be lower than that, and may be set higher. People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, good nutrition to achieve a normal body weight, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds . citation needed Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment for type diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality. Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the century, when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best isolated and purified insulin in and This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the The word diabetes ( / ˌ d aɪ .
